      <h2>Forest Resources</h2>
      <p>
        First of all before moving to any further evaluation let us understand the term what are Forest Resources.
        <br>
        Forest Resources are all the Resources we obtain from the environment that help in our survival and improves our quality of living.
        These are very important as from basics needs of the day-to-day items to  the oxygen needed every second comes all from the forest.

      <h2>Explore Forest</h2>
      <p>
        Forests are home to more than half of all species found on land, a rich variety of life that keeps many of our most vital natural systems running - from keeping our climate stable by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, to regulating our water supply and improving its quality.
        
        Over one billion people live in and around forests and depend on them for fuel, food and medicines. And all of us use wood in our daily lives, from the chair we sit on to the paper we use.

        Forests are made up of a huge number of trees in one place. The forests help us maintain a pure and clean environment which we all want. They are a great source of oxygen, take up carbon dioxide exhaled by all, and maintain the ecosystem. Forests also help maintain the ecology, and biodiversity also helps in evaporation and condensation. Not only animals but humans are also dependent on forests for various reasons. Humans are dependent on forests for medicines, food, wood, etc. and for all wild animals, it is the place for their survival and habitat.

      <h2>Deforestation - An Enemy</h2>
      <p>
        Deforestation can be defined as the large-scale removal of trees from forests (or other lands) for the facilitation of human activities. It is a serious environmental concern since it can result in the loss of biodiversity, damage to natural habitats, disturbances in the water cycle, and soil erosion. Deforestation is also a contributor to climate change and global warming.
        <br>
        Forests serve as a carbon sink by absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, deforestation is a direct contributor to the greenhouse effect and (consequently) global warming.
        <br>
        Apart from being responsible for allowing gaseous carbon dioxide to linger in the atmosphere, deforestation also contributes to increased carbon dioxide emissions. The CO2 emissions caused by deforestation account for approximately 12% of all anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Forest as being known is a very important resource for human race hence, its protection hould be our major concern. Even if we start now it would take a whole generation time to resolve the problem that we created but even now its curable so it should be done at each level we can.
        <br>
        We should adopt various measures such as stop reckless cutting of trees, abolishing the use of plastics, use papers and forest material judiciously and there are many more methods but the biggest difference is made by starting as this can only be achieved by colaborative effort of the people.
